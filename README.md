Useful Linux Commands I've created to automate my daily day-to-day tasks

# Command List

- ## **On Startup**

  This command automates some of the more minor tasks that I have to do everytime I open my computer. For example, it opens up three Google Chrome Windows to three different sites that I frequently visit every morning. These three sites are:

    - ### TLDR

        - I read TLDR every morning so it's useful to have it auto open so I can keep up-to-date with current events in the tech world. By having it auto-open, I also never forget to actually read it.

    - ### YouTube

      - I typically start off my mornings by watching some videos whilst eating breakfast or drinking my morning cup of coffee.

    - ### LinkedIn

      - I also open LinkedIn so I can keep up-to-date with my network and also keep up with any events or new opportunites that may be happening.
  
  Additionally, I open up an instance of 'Alacritty' as I like to have a terminal open in case I need to do something quick on the command line. Finally, it opens up 'Discord' so I can see what my friends are up to.

  This command is one I used often (in fact, it's in my i3 config to auto-execute every morning). It allows me to simply turn on my computer and go do something else while my computer boots up. By the time that I'm back from any of my other morning routine activities, my desktop is set up exactly as I want, and I'm ready to start the day.
